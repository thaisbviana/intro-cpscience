Dear all,
I shall declare yet another great, professional and personal deed, only accomplished through the commitment of a #pairprogramming #project. The most dedicated, patient, and relentless partner @Victor Bueno Viana has shared with me doubts, contributions, and kinship throughout our #Python #programming project. We have already shared the completion of the first part of "Introduction to Computer Science with Python", offered by the exemplary @IME professionals, a course organised and certified by @USP at @Coursera's platform. Therefore, now is the time to celebrate finishing its second part! Undoubtedly, programming is no easy feat, but having someone as careful and attentive as my #programmingpartner by your side creates an atmosphere of constant interest and lessens any frustration that might arise. I thank him once again for doing his best and for actually being a partner in this long, demanding quest (thank you, dearest, for everything you've done!). One can only hope to have contributed as much as one has received.
At each project's conclusion, not only do I reassure my competence and capabilities upon taking on the challenge of learning a new skill, but I also become more hopeful to find (or to reach) the best matching-profile work there is out there. It doesn't imply neglecting other skillsets; it entails completion, self-content, aptitude, and confidence. Ultimately, it means finding the job in which I can deploy all acquired knowledge from a variety of areas to give back to others something the of privilege I've received so far; this is doing my best, this goes beyond work.
I thank you in advance for celebrating with me!
Let us keep on learning and pursuing!
